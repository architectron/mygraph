/**
 * "As opposed to a multigraph, a simple graph is an undirected graph that has no loops (edges connected at both ends to
 * the same vertex) and no more than one edge between any two different vertices. In a simple graph the edges of the graph
 * form a set (rather than a multiset) and each edge is a distinct pair of vertices. In a simple graph with n vertices
 * every vertex has a degree that is less than n (the converse, however, is not true â€” there exist non-simple graphs
 * with n vertices in which every vertex has a degree smaller than n)."
